# Preface {.unnumbered}

## What is this book about?
This is a collection of content compiled during my journey to learn PyTorch, machine learning, and deep learning. The book will primarily cover practical applications of PyTorch and popular frameworks that build upon PyTorch, such as FastAI and Huggingface. Please note that this book is a work in progress and additional chapters will be added over time.I hope that this book, with its collection of theory and practical projects, will be useful for others who are also learning PyTorch.
