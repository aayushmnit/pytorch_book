# pytorch_book

A collection of contents in my quest to learn Pytorch, Machine learning and Deep learning. The book will focus on practical application with Pytorch and popular frameworks on top of Pytorch like FastAI, Huggingface, etc. Hopefully it will be useful for people trying to learn Pytorch too.
