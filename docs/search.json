The book will focus on practical applications with Pytorch and popular frameworks on top of Pytorch like FastAI, Huggingface, etc. This book will remain under construction and I will keep adding chapters to it. Hopefully, it will be useful for people trying to learn Pytorch too.\nRead here to learn more about the author."
